interface extends inferface
but
inteface doesnot extends class (not possible)
interface does not implements interface

class extends class
class implements interface
but
class does not extends interface

also child class inherits the overridden methods of interface from parent class

e.g:

fish implements prey , predator
baby_fish extends fish

also

interface
int id = 33;
public static final constant int id = 33;

both are same

void hunt();
public static void hunt();

both are same

class

int id
public int id
private int id
protected int id

final int id = 5;

all can be in classes
